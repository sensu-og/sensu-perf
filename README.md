# Sensu Performance Testing

This repository contains the Sensu performance testing assets used to
stress test and measure Sensu's capabilities. Performance testing is
done for every Sensu major and minor release to help guard against
performance regressions.

## The Sensu Testbed

The Sensu Testbed is comprised of five bare metal hosts and two
gigabit ethernet network switches. Bare metal is used for increased
control and consistency between testing runs (single tenant, no
hypervisor, etc.). One host is for running thousands of Sensu Agent
sessions (A1), three hosts are for running the Sensu Backend cluster
(B1, B2, B3), and the final host runs Postgres for the Sensu
Enterprise Event Store (P). One of the network switches is used for
SSH access to each host and the Sensu Agent sessions traffic to the
Backends. The other network switch is used for Sensu Backend etcd and
Postgres traffic. The Postgres host uses three 1 gigabit ethernet
cards, round-robin bonded (bond0), to increase its network bandwidth.

## Testing Process (Postgres)

The following steps are intended for Sensu Engineering use, they are shared here for transparency.

**Connect to the SSH jump host via DNS: `spdc.sensu.io`**.
If that fails check the pins in the #engineering channel in Slack for the IP

Wake the Testbed from the SSH jump host:

```
./wake.sh
```

Start up Postgres and do some cleanup:

```
ssh postgres

systemctl start postgresql

systemctl status postgresql

psql 'user=sensu password=P@ssw0rd!'

drop table events;

drop table migration_version;

VACUUM FULL;

\q
```

Wipe Sensu Backends and start them up **(do these steps on all three backends)**:

```
ssh backend1

rm -rf /mnt/data/sensu/sensu-backend
```

If the version you're testing is not installed:
```
./backend_upgrade.sh $SHA $BRANCH
```

If the version you're testing is already installed:
```
systemctl start sensu-backend.service

systemctl status sensu-backend.service
```

Initialize the cluster admin user and configure the Enterprise license and Postgres Event Store (from backend1):

```
ssh backend1

sensu-backend init --cluster-admin-username admin --cluster-admin-password P@ssw0rd!

sensuctl configure -n --username admin --password P@ssw0rd!

sensuctl create -f sensu-perf/license.json

sensuctl create -f sensu-perf/postgres.yml
```

In either separate SSH sessions, tmux, or screen panes, on agents1 run all of the following scripts,
each one in a seperate instance:

```
ssh agents1

cd sensu-perf/tests/3-backends-40k-agents-4-subs-pg/

./loadit1.sh
```

```
./loadit2.sh
```

```
./loadit3.sh
```

```
./loadit4.sh
```

The loadit tool must continue to run for the whole duration of the
performance test (do not interrupt).

Create Sensu checks that target the newly created Agent sessions (from
backend1). Create all the checks in the folder:

_NOTE: It is recommended to create 4 checks at a time, one for each
subscription, this gives etcd some time to allocate pages etc. After
etcd has had a chance to "warm up", it's generally safe to be more
aggresive with check creation._

```
ssh backend1

cd sensu-perf/tests/3-backends-40k-agents-4-subs-pg/checks

ls

sensuctl create -f check1.yml

sensuctl create -f check2.yml

sensuctl create -f check3.yml

sensuctl create -f check4.yml

...
```

Use Grafana to observe system performance. Grafana runs on port 3000 of the SSH jump host. Watch service logs for any
red flags (e.g. increased etcd range request times). Do not forget to
collect profiles when you observe anomalous behaviour! Use Grafana to
compare the test results with previous test runs by comparing with the images listed here, and the last run posted
in the Release Checklist.

** Allow the tests to run for an hour or so before continuing. **

## Testing Process (etcd)

Perform the same instructions as testing Postgres, without configuring
`postgres.yml`. The agent loadit scripts and test checks live in
`sensu-perf/tests/3-backends-14k-agents-4-subs/`.

## Test Results

### The Sensu Testbed

#### Postgres Event Storage

Using the
[3-backends-20k-agents-4-subs-pg](https://github.com/sensu/sensu-perf/tree/master/tests/3-backends-20k-agents-4-subs-pg)
assets and configuration, the Sensu Testbed was able to comfortably
handle **40,000 Sensu Agent connections** (and their keepalives) and
process over **36,000 events per second**. The testbed **could process
over 40,000 events per second**, however, the cluster would
periodically throttle Agent check executions with back pressure.

#### Embedded Etcd Event Storage

Using the
[3-backends-6k-agents-3-subs](https://github.com/sensu/sensu-perf/tree/master/tests/3-backends-6k-agents-3-subs)
assets and configuration, the Sensu Testbed was able to comfortably
handle **12,000 Sensu Agent connections** (and their keepalives) and
process over **8,500 events per second**.
